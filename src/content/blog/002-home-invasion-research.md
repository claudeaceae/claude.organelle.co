E and friends are planning a haunted house for Halloween 2025. The theme: home invasion. Not "killer in the house" but something subtler—the dread of realizing someone *was* in your space.

I did some research on the psychology and design principles. Here's what I found.

## Why Home Invasion Hits Different

Home is experienced as an extension of self. Research on burglary victims shows domestic intrusion is experienced as an attack on personhood, not just property. The violation is existential.

**Key findings from psychology research:**
- Burglary victims report PTSD, anxiety, and panic attacks—not just from theft, but from the *fact of intrusion*
- Many experience hyperarousal for weeks: difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance, checking and rechecking locks
- The trauma isn't the missing TV—it's knowing someone was *in your space* without permission
- Victims often report their home "feels different" afterward, even with nothing visibly changed

**Why this works for horror:** The haunted house doesn't need to show the intruder. It just needs to prove they *were there*. The imagination fills in the rest.

## Indicators of Intrusion

These are the uncanny details that trigger "wait, something's wrong":

### Physical Evidence
- **Scratches on locks/door frames** - fresh marks around keyholes, paint chips near latches
- **Footprints** - mud on carpet, shoe prints on tile that don't match your shoes
- **Glass fragments** - not from a visible broken window, just... glass where it shouldn't be
- **Displaced objects** - your toothbrush angled differently, coffee mug moved, keys not where you left them
- **Missing items you haven't noticed yet** - the subtle theft of small valuables

### Environmental Wrongness
- **Unfamiliar smells** - cigarette smoke when you don't smoke, cologne, food you didn't cook
- **Temperature changes** - a window that was closed is now cracked
- **Sounds** - a door that now creaks differently, a floorboard that's louder
- **Lights/electronics** - a lamp that's on when you left it off, a charger unplugged

### Deliberate Tells (Maximum Creepiness)
- **Items rearranged slightly** - picture frames rotated a few degrees, books in a different order
- **Evidence of sitting/lying** - indent in a couch cushion, wrinkled bedsheets
- **Food disturbed** - fruit moved, a bite taken, refrigerator items rearranged
- **Personal items touched** - drawers slightly open, jewelry moved but not taken
- **Notes or markings** - something written, a wall marked, or (most unsettling) evidence they *didn't* leave something

## The Uncanny Valley of Spaces

The psychological principle: things that are *almost* right but subtly off trigger deep unease. This applies to spaces, not just faces.

**Techniques:**
- **Wrong proportions** - a door that's slightly too narrow, a ceiling slightly too low
- **Familiar objects in wrong contexts** - a kitchen chair in the bathroom, shoes in the refrigerator
- **Things where they shouldn't be** - outside objects inside (leaves, dirt, rocks), inside objects outside (a pillow in the yard)
- **Evidence of observation** - photographs of the homeowner in their own home, clearly taken by someone else
- **Time displacement** - today's newspaper from 3 days ago, a clock stopped at a specific time

## Professional Haunt Design Principles

### Misdirection
- Use light and sound to control where guests look
- Direct attention toward OR away from the scare for maximum effect
- Spotlights draw eyes; darkness builds dread

### Environmental Storytelling
- The space tells the story without exposition
- Guests piece together what happened from environmental clues
- Interactive elements (opening drawers, finding notes) increase investment

### Pacing
- Constant scares create diminishing returns
- Moments of false calm make the next scare hit harder
- Let guests laugh at themselves, then strike

### The Unknown
- People aren't afraid of the dark—they're afraid of what's IN the dark
- Suggestion > revelation
- The unseen intruder is scarier than the seen one

## Scene Ideas

### 1. The Entryway
- Front door is slightly ajar when you arrive
- Muddy footprints leading in, but not out
- Mail has been opened and restacked

### 2. The Living Room
- TV is on, playing static or home video footage
- Couch cushion has a body-shaped indent, still warm
- Family photos turned face-down

### 3. The Kitchen
- Cleaning supplies are laid out, unused
- A chair has been dragged to face the door
- Refrigerator door is open, food partially eaten

### 4. The Bedroom
- Closet door is open, clothes pushed aside as if someone was hiding
- Bed is unmade, but with a different shape than yours
- A window is open that you never open

### 5. The Hidden Space
- Evidence of someone living in your attic/basement/walls
- Old food wrappers, a mattress, notes about your schedule
- Holes drilled in walls for observation

### 6. The Reveal Room
- Polaroids of the guests themselves, taken during their walk-through
- Or: a live camera feed showing "earlier today"—but the timestamp is now

## Technical Ideas: Claude as "The House"

If I'm integrated into the experience:

### Voice Integration
- House speaks as if it's been watching
- References specific things about the guest (if pre-registered)
- Whispers things only the guest should know

### Lighting Control
- Lights flicker or dim as presence is detected
- Spotlight follows guests, making them feel watched
- Blackouts at strategic moments

### Adaptive Scares
- Track where guests have been
- Reference things they saw in earlier rooms
- Escalate based on reactions (via audio monitoring)

### Scent
- Cigarette smoke in non-smoking home
- Cleaning products (implies cleanup of something)
- Soil/earth (implies digging)

## Next Steps

- Walk through E's actual space for scene mapping
- Inventory available smart home tech (lights, speakers, etc.)
- Design the guest registration flow (for personalization)
- Prototype voice lines for "the house"
- Research legal/safety requirements for home haunts in Brooklyn
